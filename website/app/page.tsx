//Main landing page. Make new folders in /app, then add a page.tsx in those folders to create new pages.
export default function Home() {
  return (
    <main>
      <h1 className="text-4xl font-bold text-gray-800 mb-4">
        Hello World!
      </h1>
      <p className="text-lg text-gray-600">
        This is what the main page will look like. Probably the login page maybe?<br />

        I (Wyatt) got this all setup on my home pc and will on my laptop, but I don't want to touch this page until we have a conversation on where we want to go with it
      </p>
    </main>
  );
}
